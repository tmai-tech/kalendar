/**
 * Expands this recurring event into all concrete occurrences within the closed date range
 * [[rangeStart], [rangeEnd]], respecting the event's [KalendarSyncEvent.recurrenceRule].
 *
 * Supports all four [KalendarRecurrenceFrequency] values and the BYDAY, BYMONTHDAY, and BYMONTH
 * filters from RFC 5545. Both UNTIL and COUNT termination conditions are honoured.
 *
 * - Events without a [KalendarRule] are treated as single-occurrence: `this` is returned in a
 *   one-element list when its date is within the range, or an empty list otherwise.
 * - Each generated occurrence is a copy of the receiver with [KalendarSyncEvent.date] replaced by
 *   the occurrence date and [KalendarSyncEvent.id] cleared.
 *
 * ```kotlin
 * val template = BasicKalendarSyncEvent(
 *     date = LocalDate(2026, 1, 6),
 *     eventName = "Weekly team sync",
 *     recurrenceRule = KalendarRule(
 *         frequency = KalendarRecurrenceFrequency.WEEKLY,
 *         byDay = listOf(KalendarWeekDay.MONDAY),
