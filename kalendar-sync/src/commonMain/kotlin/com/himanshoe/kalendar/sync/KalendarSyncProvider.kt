/**
 * Reads, writes, and exports events from the device's built-in calendar without any
 * third-party API or cloud account.
 *
 * - **Android** — backed by [CalendarContract][android.provider.CalendarContract].
 *   Requires `READ_CALENDAR` and `WRITE_CALENDAR` permissions in your manifest.
 * - **iOS** — backed by [EventKit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/eventkit).
 *   Requires `NSCalendarUsageDescription` in your `Info.plist`.
 * - **Desktop / Web** — [fetchEvents], [insertEvent], [deleteEvent] return
 *   [KalendarSyncResult.NotSupported]. Use the top-level [exportToIcs] and [importFromIcs]
 *   functions from `KalendarIcs.kt` for ICS serialization on all platforms.
 *
 * Obtain a platform instance via the `KalendarSync` factory function:
 * ```kotlin
 * // Android (inside Activity / ViewModel)
 * val sync = KalendarSync(context)
 *
 * // iOS / Desktop / Web
 * val sync = KalendarSync()
 * ```
