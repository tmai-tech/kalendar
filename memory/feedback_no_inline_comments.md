Never write inline `//` comments in Kotlin source files. Use KDoc (`/** */`) on declarations instead.

**Why:** User explicitly prefers KDoc-only style for this codebase. Inline comments clutter the code and should be expressed as KDoc on the relevant function or class instead.

**How to apply:** Any time code is written or edited in this project, strip all `//` comments (including section dividers like `// ── Helpers ──`). If the explanation is worth keeping, convert it to KDoc on the nearest declaration.
